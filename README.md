# Better FFN
Better FFN is a userscript that smooths out the user experience of 
FanFiction.Net. It adds a number of features to the site, including:
- A more modern, responsive design
- an improved dark mode

## Installation
To install Better FFN, you will need a userscript manager. I recommend 
using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), as it is the most 
popular and feature-rich userscript manager available. Once you have 
Tampermonkey installed, you can install Better FFN by clicking 
[here](betterffn.saelora.com/betterffn.user.js).

An automatic updating version of the script is available 
[here](betterffn.saelora.com/betterffn.user.js). This version will always 
remain up to date, but may be less stable than the stable version. And may 
not work with other userscript managers.

## Features
- Page redesign
  - paged reading mode, with keyboard navigation using the arrow keys.
  - Light and dark mode.
  - focus mode, while reading without moving the mouse, the UI will slide 
  away to give a more focused distraction-free reading experience.
